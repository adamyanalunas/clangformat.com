### Cache user settings
`localStorage` or something similar. Populate with "default" set if cache is empty. As user changes values, update cache.

### Deep linking
Use hash navigation or something similar. When a key is selected for inspection update URL with unique location so copy/pasta or bookmarking of URL is feasible.
